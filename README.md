# PicPick

PicPick is a Python application that helps you to compare and organize your photo collection efficiently.  If you regularly take photos, you will know that you end up with anywhere from 2 to 50 attempts at getting the "right" shot.  This is a good habit to be in from a photography stand point, but not great for keeping your photo gallery clean.  With PicPick, you can move all of the semi-duplicates in to a folder, then review them in a "Battle-Royale style" head-to-head matchup to see the last photo standing.  At the end you are left with the Best Photo, and a folder called delete, full of all the un-chosen photos, to make cleanup easier.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
